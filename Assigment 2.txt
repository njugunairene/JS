Explain what is declaration, definition and initialization in JS?
DECLARATION
Declaration is creating a variable in JavaScript. You declare a variable with the keywords var, let and const .
Var- declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
For example   var a;
                        Var plate;
Let -declares a block-scoped, local variable initializing it to a value.
      For example let x;
                               Let x=5;

Const-declares a blocked-scoped, read-only named constant.
     For example  const y=’plates’;
DEFINITION
Define ()->a module that can be returned by require ,in case you don’t  have an AMD loader . define is available in all modules like syntax and parameter.
Also require() can be used to obtain defined with define ().
Example in syntax:
Define (name, factory function)                                                                                                                                                                                      INITIALIZATION
Initialization means assigning an initial value to a variable. So undefined is the initial value of a declared variable.
